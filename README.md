# rail-rfid-desktop
Our project idea is based on reducing/eliminating theft of railway properties like pillows,blankets etc. by manipulating RFID technology.We have attached RFID chips to the in-compartment props and provided RFID MRFC522 module at entry gates of each compartment so that when an  unauthorised personnel carries any prop outside the compartment immediately an alert is live data is sent to the authorities with all the information.We have used ESP8266 and Arduino for interpreting the data as well as sending it to firebase.We have made a domain where all the data is sent and is displayed clearly.We also have added some extra features to that webpage to provide better environment for passengers and easiness of authorities.
